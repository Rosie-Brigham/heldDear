					With globalisation the world and itâ€™s people are becoming increasingly interconnected.
	        The movement of people, voluntarily or through coercion is becoming ever more common.<br>
	        While men are often trafficked into hard labour, women and children are trafficked into the commercial sex industry.
	        This involves coerced pornography, prostitution, sex trafficking and sexual slavery.<br>
	        The ease at which people can now be moved across the globe has resulted in an increase in the number of individuals sex trafficked.
	        Sex trafficking is an lucrative business, with an estimated annual profit of over 30 billion.
	        It is quickly becoming an endless source of revenue for organised crime networks around the world.<br>
	        Sexual exploitation is intrinsically tangled with gender discrimination.
	        Women and children are traded as merchandise, sold and used however the buyer sees fit.
